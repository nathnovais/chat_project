# Simple chat API

After copying/cloning the repository you need to run in your terminal within the directory of the project:

```
$ npm install
```

Afterwards you can start the project by:
```
$ node server.js
```
Or the following if you have nodemon installed
```
$ nodemon server.js
```

## Notes
There are multiple comments in the server.js file and the index.html file located in the public folder.
